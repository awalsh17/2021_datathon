**Team 2: Defining and quantifying judge "harshness**: Conduct research and analyze data to propose metrics and a process for quantifying how harsh a judge is, considering that judges are presented with different kinds of cases (e.g., offense severity). Consider:
    - if and how to stratify cases by severity (or some other characteristic)
    - how to achieve a fair comparison between judges
