**Team 1: Data Visualization**: Visualize judicial patterns at various levels of abstraction, and if possible, create an interactive dashboard:
    - Levels of abstraction: court type, judge name, defendant demographics, crime severity
    - Patterns of interest: 
        - Process: time to disposition 
        - Bail: amount, % misdemeanor cases with return on recognizance (ROR), % of cases that received reductions in bail or changes in bail type
        - Disposition: sentence length
        - Time trends: punitive sentencing, bail decisions for particular types of offenses
